Dateish
=======
A simple date parser to parse date in the following format:



```
Something Something - 05/12/2013 20:12PM PST blah blah blah 
Something Something Sun May 5, 2013
Something Something May 5, 2013
Something Something - 05/12/13 20:12PM PST blah blah blah
Something Something - May 12th, 2013 20:12PM PST blah blah blah
```

It'd extract the date and parse in US format (mm/dd/yyyy).  Also support 


npm install dateish
